# 🐍 Python Practice Repository (Fork of CodeBasics)

Welcome to **my fork** of the amazing [CodeBasics Python repository](https://github.com/codebasics/py) — a one-stop resource to kickstart and strengthen your Python programming skills! 🚀

This repository is designed especially for **beginners** and intermediate learners looking to:

- Understand core Python concepts
- Practice with real-world programming problems
- Explore common algorithms and coding patterns

## 📁 Repository Structure

This fork includes all the original content from CodeBasics, with **solutions to assignments** added in the same folders. Each solution follows the naming convention:

<original_filename>_solution.py


This makes it easy to reference the original problem and compare it with the solution side-by-side.

> ✅ All solutions are written and verified by me as part of my personal learning journey.

## 🧠 Start with the Basics

If you're just getting started, I highly recommend beginning with the [Basics](https://github.com/codebasics/py/tree/master/Basics) folder. These lessons are beginner-friendly, concise, and fun to experiment with!
